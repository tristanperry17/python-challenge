# python-challenge

This repository contains two Python Projects:
 1.) PyBank
 2.) PyPoll

PyBank analyzes profit/loss data over a range of dates to produce a summary.

PyPoll analyzes voter data for candidates in an election to produce a summary and declare a winner.

Both scripts, each titled main.py, stored in their respective folders, print output in both the terminal and text files in folders labeled "analysis".

Data used for these scripts are stored in respective folders in the "Resources" folder for each project.
